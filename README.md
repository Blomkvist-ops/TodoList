# Matrix TodoList

## Introduction

This is a to-do list where you can classify all your tasks to four types.
There are four types of tasks according to the level of urgency and importance. 
When you add tasks to the list, you need to choose which type this task is. 

You can describe these tasks, add tag to them, set hours needed, deadline and other details. 
This method to manage tasks is called "Eisenhower Method" and it helps me a lot when I have to deal with lots of different problems at the same time. 
So I would like to design it as an application to help more people.
  
  

You can see examples of this application in the following list.
