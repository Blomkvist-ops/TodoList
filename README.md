# PinkFirst TodoList

## I have four types of work

This is a todolist where you can manage all your tasks, whether they are about study, work or life. 
You can describe these tasks, add tag to them, set hours needed, deadline and other details. 
There are four types of tasks according to the level of urgency and importance. 
When you add tasks to the list, you need to choose which type this task belongs to. 
This method to manage tasks is called "Eisenhower Method" and it helps me a lot when I have to deal with lots of different problems at the same time. 
So I would like to design it as an application to help more people.
  
  
Tasks of different types have different colors. The urgent and important tasks are pink, 
the important but not urgent tasks are green, 
unimportant but urgent tasks are blue and the tasks that are not important and not urgent are gray. 
You can see examples and functions of this application in the following lists.
